# Working with Unreal Engine

- We are using Unreal Engine 5.5.4, so be extremely cautious of using deprecated or outdated APIs, includes or practices.

## Coordinate System

In the Unreal Editor, the following colors are associated with the coordinate axes:

X-axis: Red
Y-axis: Green
Z-axis: Blue

UE's Z-up, left-handed coordinate system is defined as follows:

The Z-axis determines how far up and down along a vertical line an actor is located.
Positive values are upwards.
The Y-axis determines how far to the left or right an actor is located.
Positive values are to the right.
The X-axis determines how far forward or backward an actor is located.
Positive values are forward.

## Units

Unreal Engine (UE) defaults to the following International System (SI) units for measurement:

Quantity	Unit
Distance/Length	Centimeters (cm)
Mass	Kilograms (kg)
Time	Minutes (min), Seconds (s)
Angles	Degrees (deg)
Speed/Velocity	Meters per Second (m / s)
Temperature	Celsius (C)
Force	Newtons (N)
Torque	Newton Meters (N â€¢ m)
