# Screenshot Image Loading Fix - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive fix applied to resolve screenshot image loading failures in the MegaMelange Unreal MCP system. The issue was preventing images from displaying in the web frontend, showing "Failed to load screenshot" errors.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The Python HTTP bridge was sending conflicting HTTP headers, causing binary PNG image data to be corrupted with HTTP response headers embedded in the image content.

### Symptoms
- Screenshots could be taken successfully via Unreal Engine
- Image files were created correctly on disk
- HTTP requests returned 200 status codes
- Browser displayed "Failed to load screenshot" errors
- Image URLs were accessible but returned malformed binary data

### Technical Details
The issue occurred in `http_bridge.py` where the `do_GET` method immediately sent JSON headers before determining the request type:

```python
# BROKEN CODE (before fix)
def do_GET(self):
    self.send_response(200)
    self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')  # Wrong for images!
    self.end_headers()
    # Later tried to handle file requests...
```

This caused PNG file requests to receive responses starting with HTTP headers instead of the PNG binary signature (`\x89PNG`).

## Solution Architecture

### 1. HTTP Bridge Request Handling Restructure

**File: `Python/http_bridge.py`**

- **Fixed GET handler flow**: Parse URL path before sending any headers
- **Early file detection**: Handle screenshot-file requests before JSON processing
- **Proper binary serving**: Use `_serve_file` method without header conflicts
- **Environment loading**: Added dotenv support for `UNREAL_PROJECT_PATH`

```python
# FIXED CODE (after fix)
def do_GET(self):
    # Parse URL path first
    parsed_url = urlparse(self.path)
    path = parsed_url.path
    
    # Handle file requests first (before sending any headers)
    if path.startswith('/api/screenshot-file/'):
        # Direct binary file serving
        self._serve_file(file_path)
        return
    
    # Then handle JSON requests with JSON headers
    self.send_response(200)
    self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
    self.end_headers()
```

### 2. Screenshot System Simplification

**File: `Python/tools/ai/command_handlers/rendering/screenshot.py`**

Replaced complex async job system with synchronous approach:

- **Direct file detection**: Find newest screenshot using timestamp-based monitoring
- **Immediate response**: Return file URLs directly instead of job IDs
- **Simplified workflow**: Eliminated background workers and polling complexity

```python
def execute_command(self, connection, command_type: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
    # Take screenshot via Unreal connection
    response = connection.send_command(command_type, params)
    
    # Wait for file creation and find newest screenshot
    time.sleep(0.5)
    screenshot_file = self._find_newest_screenshot()
    
    if screenshot_file:
        return {
            "success": True,
            "message": f"Screenshot saved: {screenshot_file.name}",
            "image_url": f"/api/screenshot-file/{screenshot_file.name}"
        }
```

### 3. Frontend CORS Proxy Implementation

**File: `Frontend/src/app/api/screenshot/[jobId]/route.ts`**

Enhanced Next.js proxy to handle both legacy job IDs and direct filenames:

```typescript
// Check if this looks like a filename (ends with .png)
if (jobId.endsWith('.png')) {
  // Handle direct filename requests via proxy
  const response = await fetch(`${MCP_HTTP_BRIDGE_URL}/api/screenshot-file/${jobId}`);
  const imageBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  
  return new NextResponse(imageBuffer, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'image/png',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    },
  });
}
```

**File: `Frontend/src/app/components/messages/MessageItemImageResult.tsx`**

Updated URL generation to use same-origin proxy:

```typescript
// Convert cross-origin URLs to same-origin proxy URLs
if (imageUrl.startsWith('/api/screenshot-file/')) {
  const filename = imageUrl.replace('/api/screenshot-file/', '');
  return `/api/screenshot/${filename}`; // Same-origin proxy
}
```

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Binary Data Integrity
- **Before**: HTTP headers embedded in PNG binary data
- **After**: Clean PNG binary data with proper signature (`\x89PNG`)

### 2. CORS Resolution
- **Before**: Cross-origin requests from `localhost:3004` to `localhost:8080`
- **After**: Same-origin requests through Next.js proxy

### 3. Architecture Simplification
- **Before**: Complex async job system with background workers
- **After**: Direct synchronous file serving with immediate feedback

### 4. Error Handling
- **Before**: Silent failures with malformed responses
- **After**: Proper error logging and request validation

## Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Python/.env
UNREAL_PROJECT_PATH=E:\CINEVStudio\CINEVStudio
```

### HTTP Bridge Enhancement
- Added HEAD method support for browser preflight requests
- Enhanced CORS headers with proper cache control
- Improved connection error handling

### AI Model Support
- Added Claude-3-Haiku model provider registration
- Improved JSON parsing with regex extraction for Claude responses
- Updated system prompts to reflect simplified workflow

## Verification Results

### Binary Data Validation
```bash
# Before fix: HTTP headers in binary data
$ curl -s localhost:8080/api/screenshot-file/test.png | head -c 20 | xxd
00000000: 4854 5450 2f31 2e30 2032 3030 204f 4b0d  HTTP/1.0 200 OK.

# After fix: Proper PNG binary signature
$ curl -s localhost:8080/api/screenshot-file/test.png | head -c 20 | xxd
00000000: 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452  .PNG........IHDR
```

### System Status
- ✅ Screenshots load correctly in browser without errors
- ✅ Binary PNG data served with correct headers
- ✅ Next.js proxy handles both job IDs and filenames
- ✅ CORS headers properly configured
- ✅ Environment variables loaded correctly

## Usage Examples

### Taking Screenshots
```javascript
// Frontend API call
const response = await fetch('/api/mcp', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: 'take a high resolution screenshot'
  })
});

// Response includes immediate image URL
{
  "executionResults": [{
    "success": true,
    "result": {
      "image_url": "/api/screenshot-file/HighresScreenshot00027.png"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Direct File Access
```bash
# Python bridge (direct binary)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/screenshot-file/HighresScreenshot00027.png

# Next.js proxy (same-origin)
curl http://localhost:3004/api/screenshot/HighresScreenshot00027.png
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Server Logs
```
INFO:MCPHttpBridge:GET request received: /api/screenshot-file/test.png
INFO:MCPHttpBridge:Serving screenshot file: test.png
```

### Frontend Console
```javascript
console.log('Using Next.js proxy URL for filename:', proxyUrl);
// Output: "Using Next.js proxy URL for filename: /api/screenshot/test.png"
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check HTTP bridge health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check screenshot directory
ls "E:\CINEVStudio\CINEVStudio\Saved\Screenshots\WindowsEditor"
```

## Future Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Image Caching**: Implement client-side image caching for frequently accessed screenshots
2. **Format Support**: Add support for additional image formats (JPEG, WebP)
3. **Compression**: Implement image compression for faster loading
4. **CDN Integration**: Consider CDN integration for production deployments

### Security Enhancements
1. **Path Validation**: Add stricter path validation to prevent directory traversal
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for screenshot endpoints
3. **Authentication**: Add authentication for screenshot access in production

### Monitoring Improvements
1. **Metrics Collection**: Add metrics for screenshot generation and access patterns
2. **Error Tracking**: Implement error tracking for failed screenshot operations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor response times and file serving performance

## Conclusion

The screenshot image loading fix successfully resolves the core issue through a comprehensive approach that addresses HTTP header conflicts, simplifies system architecture, and implements proper CORS handling. The solution provides immediate visual feedback for screenshot operations while maintaining system reliability and performance.

The simplified synchronous approach eliminates complexity while providing better user experience, and the proxy pattern ensures cross-origin compatibility without security concerns.
